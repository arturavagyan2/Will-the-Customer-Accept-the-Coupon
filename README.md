# Will-the-Customer-Accept-the-Coupon

## Project Overview

This project investigates factors influencing whether drivers accept location-based coupons delivered to their mobile devices during a drive. The dataset contains demographic, behavioral, contextual, and coupon-related attributes collected via an Amazon Mechanical Turk survey.

The primary goal is to identify patterns and insights that distinguish between drivers who accept a coupon versus those who do not â€” with a focus on the **Bar** and **Coffee House** coupon types.

## Key Findings

### Bar Coupon Insights:
- Drivers who **go to bars more than 3 times a month** have a **76.9%** acceptance rate.
- Those who go to bars **frequently and are over 25** accept coupons at **69.5%**, compared to just **33.5%** of others.
- Acceptance increases to **71.3%** when filtering further to exclude passengers who are **kids** and occupations like **farming/fishing/forestry**.
- A combined group with behavioral and demographic traits (frequent bar-goers, young, low income, social flexibility) showed a **61.2%** acceptance rate vs. **29.6%** for others.

### Coffee House Coupon Insights:
- Overall acceptance rate: **49.9%**
- Highest acceptance among those **driving with friends (59.7%)** or **partners (57.0%)**
- Lowest acceptance when driving **alone (43.8%)** or with **kids (48.3%)**
- Suggests coffee trips are seen as social events rather than solo or family activities

## Hypotheses

- **Social context matters**: Passengers (especially friends or partners) increase the likelihood of accepting social-type coupons like coffee or bar offers.
- **Behavioral frequency is predictive**: Users who already frequent bars or restaurants are significantly more responsive to related coupons.
- **Demographics and lifestyle interactions** (e.g., age, income, marital status) influence how likely a person is to redeem a coupon.
